# SchoolSurvey
SchoolSurvey is an Android application containing a simple survey rating a class and its instructor. The design has been emphasized so the user may swipe through the survey, going back and forth, until they have completed all of the questions and are ready to submit. Afterwards, the results may be viewed as desired.
